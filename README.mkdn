# Clean Reply for Thunderbird

**THIS PROJECT IS NOT YET IN A USABLE STATE.**

## About

This is a redesign and modernization of an old Thunderbird addon I created
called [AutoRewrap](http://autorewrap.mozdev.org/). That addon simply
rewrapped the reply text when you replied to an email that had long lines
in it. This addon will start with that and add other similar housekeeping
routines.
